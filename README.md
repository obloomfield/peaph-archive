# Phillips Exeter Academy Puzzle Hunt Archive

# [PUZZLES BY YEAR](puzzles-by-year/)

Hello there! This archive is a work-in-progress. We are currently working on proper solution documentation for all of our past puzzles, and are about 50% complete. Past specific puzzle content, we are thinking of some day including on here some of our design methodology and puzzle-crafting "best-practices" (much alike [this lovely blog post](http://web.mit.edu/dwilson/www/puzzles/puzzlewriting.html)). 

The Arecibo observatory collapsed recently, proving our hopeful extra-terrestrial contact a "no-go," which means, sadly, we will not be able to archive or provide solutions for ongoing / future hunts. Once a future hunt is complete, however, in due time it will make its way onto this site.

*Note: The search toolbar in the top left does work! With a larger group's support, I am thinking of tagging each puzzle by keyword sometime in the future to allow more search possibilities than just name or authorship.*

*The [RunDocs theme](https://rundocs.io/) used for this site is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://www.mit.edu/~amini/LICENSE.md)*
